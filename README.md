# Terminal Chess Game

This project was completed as part of The Odin Project.

## About the project

I taught myself Ruby by implementing a chess engine that allows players to play through the terminal. I am currently adding features to the engine, all listed in ```todo.txt```.


## Playing the game

```ruby play_game.rb```

Enjoy!
