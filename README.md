# Terminal Chess Game

This project was completed as part of The Odin Project.

## About the project

I taught myself Ruby by implementing a chess engine that allows players to play through the terminal. I am currently adding features to the engine, all listed in ```todo.txt```.


## Playing the game
Please note that your terminal session needs to have a light background for the pieces to render properly.
Run the following command in your terminal:
```ruby play_game.rb```

At any point throughout the game, you may save the game with the 'save' command or resign with the 'quit' command. You can additionally combine the commands if you wish to save the game and resign.

To continue playing a saved game at a later time, run ```ruby play_saved_game.rb``` in your terminal. Enter the file descriptor you used to save the game previously.

Enjoy!
